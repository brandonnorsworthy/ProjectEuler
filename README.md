# Project Euler Solutions

[![Progress](https://projecteuler.net/profile/bnorsworthy.png)](https://projecteuler.net/profile/bnorsworthy.png)

### About
 - All code is 100% written by my without looking at a single solution before solving it, I normally dont go back and change my first attempt either unless its to make it faster for me to get the result. The only think I research is helpful methods I could use for the math problem.
 - This repository will contain all solution **.cpp** files from my builds while solving problems from [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
 - Each archive problem will have its own corresponding C++ file
 - All C++ is written in Microsoft's Visual Studio 2017/2019 IDE using C++ 11
 - All Python3 is written in VS Code using python 3.7-3.9
 - Answers.txt Contains all solutions I have found with the problem number corresponding to the answer UPDATE: not doing this anymore no point
 - I am a College Student, my code may not be to the level of a professional yet so please respect that I am still learning to write cleaner and more efficently
### Goals
 - I would like to try to solve a problem once a day but I do work and go to school so I can only try my best
 - Once reaching 100 solved solutions I would like to go back and try to learn python by going through the same problems (1-100) or continuing on after (100) with my new aquired knowledge of critical thinking
